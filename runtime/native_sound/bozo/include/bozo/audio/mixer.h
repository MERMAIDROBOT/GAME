// The native sound mixer: the game's sample banks (PS2 ADPCM, as its drivers upload them) played by 48 voices (two
// groups of 24, as libsd addresses them) with their pitch, ADSR envelope and volume, mixed at 48 kHz. There is no sound
// chip here: no registers, no DMA, no interrupts, no chip timing. What a driver sets is a voice's playback state, what
// it reads back (a voice's envelope, which voices reached their end) is that state as it plays. Its behaviour, as
// drivers observe it, is docs/specs/libraries.md section 15.14.
//
// Reverb: each group's effect send through libsd's reverb presets (room ... pipe, echo and delay with their delay
// time and feedback), the reverb's delay lines in sound memory below the effect end address as the drivers place
// them, at 24 kHz, mixed back at the group's effect volume.
//
// The sound data input: a driver's PCM stream (sceSdBlockTrans) played from its buffer in IOP memory, 16-bit stereo at
// 48 kHz in blocks of 256 left samples then 256 right, looping or once, with a signal at each half for the driver to
// refill the other. Each group's mix (MMIX) routes the voices, the input and (group 1) group 0's output to the output
// and the reverb.
//
// Not done: noise, pitch modulation.
//
// Moved from the team's own code on the PS2Recomp fork (PLAN.md section 7).
